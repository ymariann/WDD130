    <h2>Mari</h2>
    <p>Hola! My name is Marianela but everyone calls me Mari or Maru. I'm 23 years old (soon 24 ðŸ¥³) and I'm from Rosario, but currently living in Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
    <p>I want to get a degree in Professional studies and learn more about graphic design, marketing, and business. I'm currently working in a marketing company and I love my job.</p>
    <p>What I love the most in BYU is the freedom to choose the learnings that will be helpful for my life and job. I also love that I can manage my time, spending it wisely to work, study, and be with y family and friends.</p>
    <p>I'm a member of the church since I was born. The first member of the church in my family was my great great grandmother. She was baptized around 1930 and was loyal to the gospel until the last day of her life. She taught her family, daughters, granddaughters, and even to her husband, who was baptized many years after her. She is an example for me and my role mode.</p>
